        "\n",
        "Consider a double pendulum mounted on a cart, where the cart has mass $m$ and the pendulum has two rods with lengths $l_1$ and $l_2$. Point masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ are attached to the rods. The rods are assumed to be massless.\n",

Also, to ensure that the mean value is withen the range $(-1,1)$ we have used a $tanh$ activation for the mean value and a $softplus$ activation for the standard devitation to ensure that it is always positive."
